ABOUT

This is ODAudioSystem, the OpenDarwin interface to the IOAudioFamily,
enabling you to play sound through your speakers. It was written by
Dan Christiansen, see the file LICENSE for details.

This driver is meant to be as simple as possible. Rather than
providing full support for all features supported by IOAudioFamily, it
reveals the smallest useful subset of features.

REQUIREMENTS

OpenDarwin 6.6.1 (or later), does not work on Mac OS X. Untested on
Apple Darwin and GNU/Darwin. Untested on i386.

USAGE

- to compile ODAudioSystem, type 'make'
- to create the kernel extension, type 'make dist'
- to load and unload the kext, type 'make load' and 'make unload'

You should now have a /dev/dspN entry for every supported audio device
in your computer. It most likely supports 44.1kHz native endian
audio. I recommend dd or cat for playing, a small sample script is in
'util/play'.

LIMITATIONS

- no volume control
- no line out
- no more than 256 sound cards at once
- only supports exclusive access to each device
- does not work on Mac OS X
- no recording support

DISCLAIMER

This is open source software; no guarantee or support is made what so
ever. This driver *may* cause your computer to self-destruct, although
I find that somewhat unlikely.
