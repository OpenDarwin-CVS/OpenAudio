ABOUT

This is OpenAudio, the OpenDarwin interface to IOAudioFamily.
Currently, it consists of a kernel extension enabling you to play
sound through your speakers. It was written by Dan Christiansen, see
the file LICENSE for details.

This driver is meant to be as simple as possible. Rather than
providing full support for all features supported by IOAudioFamily, it
reveals the smallest useful subset of features.

REQUIREMENTS

OpenDarwin 6.6.1 (or later), does not work on Mac OS X. Untested on
Apple Darwin and GNU/Darwin. Untested on i386.

USAGE

To compile OpenAudio and install a non-debug version:
make release

To load the kernel extension without rebooting:
sudo make -C kext reload

You should now have a /dev/dsp entry for every supported audio device
in your computer. It most likely supports 44.1kHz native endian
audio. I recommend dd or cat for playing, a small sample script is in
'util/play'.

SUPPORTED APPLICATIONS

EsounD was attempted ported, but it sucked too much.

MPlayer has been ported to OpenDarwin, and patches are available in
the 'other' subdirectory: Apply the patch and create a link
ao_darwin.c in MPlayer's libao2 subdirectory.

LIMITATIONS

- no more than 256 sound cards at once
- only supports exclusive access to each device
- does not work on Mac OS X
- no recording support

DISCLAIMER

This is open source software; no guarantee or support is made what so
ever. This driver *may* cause your computer to self-destruct, although
I find that somewhat unlikely.
